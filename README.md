# Lab 6 - *Photo-Map*

**Photo-Map** is an app that allows the user to search for locations using the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) and create a pin with an image annotation.

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can view a map (+2pt)
- [x] User can take a photo (+1pt)
- [x] User can tag a location (+1pt)
- [x] User can drop a pin with image annotation (+1pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User sees a custom annotation (+1pt)
- [x] User can see Fullscreen Picture (+1pt)
- [x] User sees a custom image for the "pin" (+1pt)
- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

  1. I would want to be able to resize image when I zoom out.
  2. I would want to persist my images taken with the app.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to resize image on zooming.
2. How and where I would save my persisted images.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

  1. Creating a delegate was a bit confusing on where I would put the function and how I would use it.
  2. Customizing the pins was a bit confusing and I still don't how how i would change background color for pin title.
